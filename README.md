# synth
Basic synthesizer in python


Currently supports 4 methods:
-f sine
-f square
-f harmonics
-f even-harmonics

to generate functions. It will then play the function using pyaudio
and plot the function and its FFT.

Currently no way to modify the parameters of these generators other
than editing the code
